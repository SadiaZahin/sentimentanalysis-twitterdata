Python Version: Python 3.8.2

Packages used: sklearn, numpy, pickle, csv, os, nltk, tensorflow, keras, operator, os

For running the code, the following files need to be in the same folder as the classification.py script.

1. RNNSentimentClassifier.py
2. SentimentClassifiers.py
3. glove.6B.100d.txt

Also the train and test datasets should be inside the 'semeval-tweets' folder.

I have also changed the classification.py file to accomodate 4 classifiers instead of three.
